# Revisiting Machine Learning from Scratch (with a book!)

One of my personal goals for the year 2024 is to revisit the basics of machine learning in a more formal approach. I've been working with developing ML models and systems for over 3 years now, but I've never took the time to dive deep in the math and do some exercises like a college course. Of course, I've did lots of courses and personal projects on ML, but for this year, I want to go further on the understanding on what lies behind the curtain for each model and approach I want to use.

## So, where to start?

Going into a graduate level book seemed a very frightening idea at first, so I decided to start with a book that's more focused on the practical aspect, while showing a bit of the math behind the models and concepts. In fact, this book is kind of the "smaller brother" for a more known book, that's used in graduate courses from world-renowned universities.

The book in question is "Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. It's a very well written book, with lots of examples and exercises, and it's free to download [here](https://www.statlearning.com/). I'll be using the Python version of the book, released not so long ago. You can also find the `pdf` for this book in this repository as well.

Other positive thing about this book is that it has a series of video-lectures that are freely available on YouTube. You can find them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvySJGj-88U&list=PLoROMvodv4rPP6braWoRt5UCXYZ71GZIQ&ab_channel=StanfordOnline).

## The approach

To avoid spending lots of time doing notes on every paragraph, I've came up with a simple 3-steps approach for how I'm going to study each chapter.

1. Watch the video-lecture for the chapter. Usually, each chapter is composed of 5 to 6 video lectures, ranging anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes each. After that, I'll have a grasp on the concepts that the chapter will cover.

2. Read the chapter. This is the most important step. I'll read the chapter, taking notes on the most important concepts and doing the exercises. Some concepts that I find more difficult or that are broadly tackled, I'll do some extra research and try to come out with some kind of blog post on it (e.g. the bias-variance tradeoff, presented on chapter 2).

3. Answer the questions. Each chapter has a series of questions that are meant to test the understanding of the concepts presented. Those questions are divided in 2 areas: conceptual and practical. Each folder in this repository contains a markdown for answering the conceptual questions and folder with Jupyter Notebooks for answering the practical ones.

## Where to go from here?

Well, I've just started this journey, and on the time I'm writing this `README.md` file, I've just finished reading the first and second chapters, and answered the questions for them. I'll be updating this repository as I go through the book, and hope to finish it by the end of the year (hopefully sooner!).

After that, I'll probably go for the "big brother" of this book, which is "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by the same authors. It's a more advanced book, and it's used in graduate courses in universities like Stanford and MIT. I'll probably do the same approach as I'm doing with this book, but I'll probably take more time to finish it, since it needs more time to digest the concepts, shown in a more mathematical way. Probably I'll be reviewing concepts from linear algebra and calculus as well, since they are used extensively in the book.

## The journey

Learning is a never-ending journey, and I don't feel that coming back to more basic concepts is a waste of time. In fact, I think it's a great way to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired so far, and to learn new things as well. I hope this repository can be useful for someone else as well, and I'll be happy to discuss the concepts with anyone who's interested.
